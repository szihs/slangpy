slangpy.reflection
==================

The ``slangpy.reflection`` module is a wrapper around the Slang reflection API
exposed by SGL. It is used extensively internally to SlangPy, but is a useful way
of introspecting the Slang code in general. The most common way to access reflection
data is by accessing the ``SlangProgramLayout`` of a module via the
``Module.layout`` attribute.
