Changelog
=========

SlangPy uses a `semantic versioning <http://semver.org>`__ policy for its API.

Version 0.41.0 (April 15, 2026)
-------
- Rewrite of Tensors and removal of NDBuffer in favour of unified Tensor type.
  (PR `#697 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/697>`__)
- **Kernel generation overhaul**: Rewrote kernel generation with direct binding, entry point arguments,
  and removal of trampoline functions for cleaner and more efficient generated shaders.
  (PR `#863 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/863>`__, PR `#870 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/870>`__,
  PR `#876 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/876>`__, PR `#879 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/879>`__)
- **Move cached function call path from Python to C++** for significantly reduced per-call overhead.
  (PR `#869 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/869>`__)
- **Native PyTorch autograd integration**: Full native torch autograd support with ``retain_graph``,
  proper VRAM lifecycle management, and ``torch.nn.parameter.Parameter`` compatibility.
  (PR `#816 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/816>`__, PR `#781 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/781>`__,
  PR `#921 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/921>`__, PR `#891 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/891>`__)
- **CUDA performance optimization**: Reduced CUDA context management overhead by ~20× by removing per-call
  context push/pop from slang-rhi. When using PyTorch interop, the shared primary context is already set
  by PyTorch, so no user action is typically required. For edge cases, new APIs are exposed:

  - ``device.set_cuda_context_current()`` - Set context for this thread (multi-GPU, multi-threading)
  - ``device.cuda_context_scope()`` - Context manager for temporary context switching

  (PR `#774 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/774>`__)
- **Dispatch hot path optimizations**: Eliminate heap allocations from cached dispatch, pack/unpack
  optimization, optimized value types, explicit shader object binding, block allocator, cached device
  addresses, short vector for shader object refs, and optimised uniform setting of tensors.
  (PR `#872 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/872>`__, PR `#815 <https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy/pull/815>`__,
